        <p class="background-text">I shall largely speak of mice, but my thoughts are
on man, on healing, on life and its evolution.
Threatening life and evolution are the two deaths,
death of the spirit and death of the body. Evolution, in terms of ancient wisdom, is the acquisition
of access to the tree of life. This takes us back to
the white first horse of the Apocalypse which with
its rider set out to conquer the forces that
threaten the spirit with death. Further in Revelation (ii.7) we note: 'To him who conquers I will
grant to eat the tree' of life, which is in the
paradise of God' and further on (Rev. xxii.2):
'The leaves of the tree were for the healing of
nations.'
This takes us to the fourth horse of the
Apocalypse (Rev. vi.7): 'I saw ... a pale horse,
and its rider's name was Death, and Hades
followed him; and they were given power over a
fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with
famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of
the earth' (italics mine). This second death has
gradually become the predominant concem of
modern medicine. And yet there is nothing in the
earlier history of medicine, or in the precepts
embodied in the Hippocratic Oath, that precludes
medicine from being equally concerned with
healing the spirit, and healing nations, as with
healing the body. Perhaps we might do well to
reflect upon another of John's transcriptions
(Rev. ii. 1): 'He who conquers shall not be hurt
by the second death.'I shall largely speak of mice, but my thoughts are

threaten the spirit with death. Further in Revelation (ii.7) we note: 'To him who conquers I will
grant to eat the tree' of life, which is in the
paradise of God' and further on (Rev. xxii.2):

nations.'
This takes us to the fourth horse of the
Apocalypse (Rev. vi.7): 'I saw ... a pale horse,
and its rider's name was Death, and Hades
followed him; and they were given power over a
fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with
famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of
the earth' (italics mine). This second death has
gradually become the predominant concem of
modern medicine. And yet there is nothing in the
earlier history of medicine, or in the precepts
embodied in the Hippocratic Oath, that precludes
medicine from being equally concerned with
healing the spirit, and healing nations, as with
healing the body. Perhaps we might do well to
reflect upon another of John's transcriptions
(Rev. ii. 1): 'He who conquers shall not be hurt
by the second death.'I shall largely speak of mice, but my thoughts are
on man, on healing, on life and its evolution.
Threatening life and evolution are the two deaths,
death of the spirit and death of the body. Evolution, in terms of ancient wisdom, is the acquisition
of access to the tree of life. This takes us back to
the white first horse of the Apocalypse which with
its rider set out to conquer the forces that
threaten the spirit with death. Further in Revelation (ii.7) we note: 'To him who conquers I will

followed him; and they were given power over a
fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with
famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of
the earth' (italics mine). This second death has
gradually become the predominant concem of
modern medicine. And yet there is nothing in the
earlier history of medicine, or in the precepts
embodied in the Hippocratic Oath, that precludes
medicine from being equally concerned with
healing the spirit, and healing nations, as with
healing the body. Perhaps we might do well to
reflect upon another of John's transcriptions
(Rev. ii. 1): 'He who conquers shall not be hurt
by the second death.'I shall largely speak of mice, but my thoughts are
on man, on healing, on life and its evolution.
Threatening life and evolution are the two deaths,
death of the spirit and death of the body. Evolution, in terms of ancient wisdom, is the acquisition
of access to the tree of life. This takes us back to
the white first horse of the Apocalypse which with
its rider set out to conquer the forces that
threaten the spirit with death. Further in Revelation (ii.7) we note: 'To him who conquers I will
grant to eat the tree' of life, which is in the
paradise of God' and further on (Rev. xxii.2):
'The leaves of the tree were for the healing of
nations.'
This takes us to the fourth horse of the
Apocalypse (Rev. vi.7): 'I saw ... a pale horse,
and its rider's name was Death, and Hades
followed him; and they were given power over a
