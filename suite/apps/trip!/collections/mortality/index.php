        <p>5-MeO-DMT (6) is a tryptamine natural product most commonly identified as the primary psychoactive component of the parotid gland secretions of Incilius alvarius, the Sonoran Desert toad (Figure 2).(11) The alkaloid is also known to be present in low concentrations in a variety of plants, shrubs, and seeds. Human consumption of this material for its psychoactive properties has been reported in the scientific literature for at least 100 years.(12−15) Although it has been historically suggested that 5-MeO-DMT may have been used by indigenous cultures,(11) there is no known documentation to support this assertion. Due to the recent discovery of high concentrations of 5-MeO-DMT in I. alvarius secretions, there has been a reported increase in its recreational and spiritual use.(11,16,17) Recent evidence has indicated the presence of 5-MeO-DMT existing in concentrations between<a href="../sheknows">Learning To Make Peace</a> 20 and 30% of total dry weight or approximately 200–300 mg of 5-MeO-DMT per dried gram of toad secretion,(17) concentrations much higher when compared to plant-derived sources of 5-MeO-DMT. Anecdotally, and suggested by research over the last 5 years, 5-MeO-DMT has been reported to be helpful in treating clinical mental health conditions.(8,9,16−18) These data suggest that 5-MeO-DMT produces mystical experiences with comparative intensity as seen with psilocybin,(8) has a significantly shorter duration of effect—between 10 and 45 min depending on the route of administration used,(19) and produces increased desired effects when the context of the experience is carefully curated.(20,21)
An extensively supported hypothesis is that commonly encountered psychedelic effects in humans (e.g., visual hallucinations, altered sense</p><img class="image one" src="img/friends.jpg" /><p>of self, time, and space, and atypical thought patterns) are mediated primarily via activation of the serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor in the central nervous system (CNS).(22,23) Notably, all currently known psychedelics are also nonselective, simultaneously interacting with numerous other monoaminergic receptors and transporters in the CNS, and hence exhibit variable degrees of synergistic polypharmacology in addition to agonist activity at the 5-HT2A receptor.(24) 5-MeO-DMT has demonstrated sub-micromolar binding affinity across most serotonin receptor subtypes expressed in the CNS, with about 300-fold selectivity for the human 5-HT1A (3 ± 0.2 nM) versus 5-HT2A (907 ± 170 nM) receptor subtypes.(25) Data has suggested that activation of the 5-HT1A receptor may also play a significant role in contributing to</p><img class="image two" src="img/tank.jpg" /><p>the subjective and behavioral effects elicited by psychedelics in a synergistic way with 5-HT2A activation.(26−28) In contrast to 5-MeO-DMT, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) is about 5-fold more selective for human 5-HT2A receptors (107 nM) versus 5-HT1A (567 nM).(29) In a controlled study in healthy human volunteers, coadministration of psilocin with the antianxiety medication buspirone, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, altered the subjective effects produced by psilocin, notably reducing the intensity of certain visual hallucinations.(30) Interestingly, anecdotal reports on 5-MeO-DMT consumption have described a general lack of colorful geometric visual hallucinations typically associated with other psychedelics.(31)
To date, a comprehensive understand</p><img class="image two" src="img/tank.jpg" /><p>ing of the correlation between psychedelics’ polypharmacology and the corresponding influence on their subjective effects is not well established. While a number of potential mechanisms have been hypothesized to rationalize the therapeutic mode of action of psychedelics, such as increased structural plasticity in the prefrontal cortex,(32) still no direct connection has been made between specific psychedelic pharmacodynamics and positive therapeutic outcomes.(33) Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials with the psychedelic psilocybin (1) in the treatment of serious mental health conditions such as major depressive disorder (MDD) continue to show promise.(34) To this end, 5-MeO-DMT appears to be pharmacodynamically unique compared to previous clinically studied psychedelics and could provide a useful comparator in contemporary controlled clinical studies with psychedelics to better understand their mode of action.
Unlike psilocybin, psychedelic tryptamines such as DMT (2) and 5-MeO-DMT (6) are subject to rapid first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase and are therefore not orally active. When consumed parenterally, they produce a significantly shorter duration of action, typically less than 1 h, compared to the 5–8 h duration of effects produced by psilocybin. The shorter duration of action may help in reducing the amount of time a patient w</p><img class="image three" src="img/globe.gif" /><p>ould spend in the clinic. Additionally, compared to DMT, 5-MeO-DMT is known to be approximately 10–20 times more potent in humans.(13) With a short duration of action and possibly significant 5-HT1A receptor selectivity, 5-MeO-DMT possesses unique pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties compared to other clinically studied psychedelics. These features may correlate with more positive therapeutic outcomes in controlled human clinical trials. To test this hypothesis and to better understand the psychotherapeutic utility of 5-MeO-DMT and enable such clinical trials, the preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is required with adequate controls to ensure its identity, potency, purity, and strength. The development of this process is the topic of this report. The most commonly reported route of administration is by vaporization of the freebase drug, which is generally not a pharmaceutically acceptable approach compared to other dosage forms. While other intraperitoneal routes of administration with 5-MeO-DMT such as dry powder inhalation, transdermal, or intravenous administration are possible, an intramuscular injection has been identified as a preferable compromise for administering this material. In addition to allowing precise metering of dose, the intramuscular injection of 5-MeO-DMT in a naturalistic setting has been previously reported and was claimed to possess an advantageous duration of action compared to the intense rapid-onset produced by other intraperitoneal routes.(19) The injectable drug formulated as a 20 mg/mL solution of API in sterile water with excipients is capable of delivering a precise dose of API in the range of 2–15 mg, consistent with the dose range described in previous anecdotal reports with this material. 5-MeO-DMT freebase has low water solubility (10 mg/mL) and the unionized amine may degrade on exposure to atmospheric oxygen to give the corresponding N-oxide degradant (vide infra). A water-soluble, pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of 5-MeO-DMT was therefore required.
In parallel to the exploration of viable synthetic routes to 5-MeO-DMT freebase, a range of pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms were considered from acids with sufficient pKa difference to fully protonate 6, including the counterions chloride, sulfate, fumarate, succinate, maleate, lysate, oxalate, benzoate, tartrate, mesylate, or acetate.(35) Using analytically pure 5-MeO-DMT freebase, the hydrochloride, sulfate, fumarate, and succinate salts were initially evaluated. Attempts at formation of the sulfate salt yielded an intractable gum and the approach was abandoned. The hydrochloride salt was readily prepared as an apparent crystalline solid, but the material was found to be hygroscopic and was deliquescent under high-humidity conditions. Both the fumarate and succinate salts were readily prepared and provided stable, free-flowing, crystalline materials. The fumarate salts of structurally analogous tryptamines are commonly reported, possibly due to their ease of synthesis.(36) DMT (2) fumarate, for example, has been previously used in clinical studies as an intravenous injection.(37) Fumaric acid is, however, a known Michael acceptor and has been shown to form covalent products with amine-containing APIs under mild conditions.(38,39) Given that terminal sterilization by an autoclave may be required in the future preparation of sterile solutions of the 5-MeO-DMT drug product, the potential for this known reactivity with fumaric acid eliminated it as an acceptable salt form. Succinic acid is a structurally similar dicarboxylic acid but lacks the conjugated double bond present in fumaric acid and would not exhibit similar chemical reactivity.
The succinate salt was therefore explored further as a potential pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. The material was prepared and subjected to thorough solid-state characterization, including equilibrium water solubility, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hyper-DSC, dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and optical microscopy (see the Supporting Information). Briefly, 5-MeO-DMT succinate (1:1) was not hygroscopic and XRPD indicated that multiple crystallization conditions resulted in a common stable crystalline anhydrate (form A) with only a few conditions that formed unique solvated forms (see the Supporting Information). The data supported the use of 5-MeO-DMT succinate (1:1) as a stable and pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. </p><img class="image three" src="img/globe.gif" /><p></p><img class="image three" src="img/globe.gif" /><p></p><img class="image three" src="img/globe.gif" /><p>Given its ease of synthesis and favorable solid-state properties, this salt form was selected for further development.
5-MeO-DMT Route Scouting
For clinical development, the ideal synthetic route to 5-MeO-DMT would utilize commercially available starting materials, would be scalable to readily provide the product in the range of 0.1–1 kg, would not rely on flash silica gel chromatography or fractionation, and would provide a high-purity final product with no unidentified individual impurity >0.15% peak area by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The literature survey revealed three potentially viable synthetic routes, and each was explored and evaluated for the ability to meet the above criteria.
Route 1
A seemingly attractive single-step process employed a modified Eschweiler–Clarke reaction via reductive amination between formaldehyde and commercially available 5-methoxy tryptamine (7) with sodium cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent (Scheme 1).(40) Several small-scale attempts were initially evaluated with reaction monitoring by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). Though product formation was evident, the reaction was plagued by challenges that would likely multiply at larger scales. The Pictet–Spengler reaction to the corresponding tryptoline (8) was difficult to suppress and removal of this structurally similar and possibly biologically active byproduct was challenging. Further optimization to Route 1 may be possible, but ultimately, the reaction was not recommended for further development. A related reaction involving N-methylation of tryptamine 7 by methyl iodide has also been suggested; however, this approach would inevitably lead to difficult-to-control quaternization at the amine and was therefore also not considered for large-scale synthesis. The Speeter–Anthony tryptamine synthesis (Scheme 2) is the most cited general method for preparing substituted psychedelic tryptamines and has also been used to prepare 5-MeO-DMT previously.(31,41) Given recent learnings and optimizations from the large-scale synthesis of psilocin and psilocybin produced by an analogous process, the route was considered for the large-scale synthesis of 6 from 5-methoxyindole 9.(42−44) A key consideration in this approach is performing the final reduction on the ketoamide 10 with pyrophoric lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) with the subsequent quench and tedious extraction from solid aluminum waste salts; the difficulty of this process tends to increase with scale. Our data has indicated that in most cases when synthesizing tryptamines, the reduction step will stall at approximately 90% conversion with 5–10% of an expected β-hydroxy intermediate, such as 11, remaining (Scheme 2). On workup, further manipulations of the crude freebase, especially acidic conditions, can initiate conversion of the β-hydroxy impurity to a reactive electrophile, such as 12 (Scheme 2), and give mixtures of isomeric dimerized impurities. Crookes et al. provided a thorough investigation into the formation of analogous dimeric byproducts in the LAH reduction to produce DMT (2) by the mechanism analogous to the depiction in Scheme 2.(45) Though Route 2 was a viable process, given the known challenges with scale-up, this route would require additional process development to ensure that the final product could reliably meet high-purity specifications without relying on column chromatography. Therefore, a single-step procedure based on the Fischer indole reaction was next explored.

Route 3
Several attributes inherent to the Fischer indole reaction approach to 6 from 4-methoxyphenylhydrazine (13) and 4,4-diethoxy-N,N-dimethylbutan-1-amine (14), a masked aldehyde protected as the diethyl acetal derivative (Scheme 3A), were attractive for the development of a scalable process: the transformation occurs in a single step, it does not rely on high temperatures, occurs in aqueous solvent, and does not rely on air-sensitive or pyrophoric reactants such as lithium aluminum hydride. Additionally, literature precedent exists for its use specifically in the synthesis of 5-MeO-DMT in addition to related substituted N,N-dimethyltryptamines,(46) with reported examples for the use of an analogous process in the commercial manufacture of structurally similar 5-substituted dimethyltryptamine antimigraine medicines, such as sumatriptan (15), zolmitriptan (16), and rizatriptan (17) (Scheme 3B).(47) Importantly, the pharmaceutical relevance of tryptamines 15–17 provided some assurance that the key butanamine starting material 14 common to all three processes was well-characterized and would remain commercially available and inexpensive. The Speeter–Anthony tryptamine synthesis (Scheme 2) is the most cited general method for preparing substituted psychedelic tryptamines and has also been used to prepare 5-MeO-DMT previously.(31,41) Given recent learnings and optimizations from the large-scale synthesis of psilocin and psilocybin produced by an analogous process, the route was considered for the large-scale synthesis of 6 from 5-methoxyindole 9.(42−44) A key consideration in this approach is performing the final reduction on the ketoamide 10 with pyrophoric lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) with the subsequent quench and tedious extraction from solid aluminum waste salts; the difficulty of this process tends to increase with scale.
